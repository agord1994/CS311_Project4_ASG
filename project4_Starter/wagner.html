                                Richard Wagner was born in Venice on May 22, 1813. As a youth, he
                                studied music in Leipzig. His first opera, "Die Feen" was written at the
                                age of 20, in 1833. This was followed in 1836 with the unsuccessful
                                "Das Liebesverbot". That same year, Wagner married the actress Minna
                                Planer. Wagner and his family lived for a few years in Königsberg, and
                                then later, in Riga. While in Paris from 1839 to 1842, he composed the
                                grand opera, "Rienzi," and the tragedy, "Der Fliegende Holländer."</br>
                            </br>
                                The success of "Rienzi" led to Wagner's appointment as music director in
                                Dresden. More successes followed with "Tannhäuser" in 1845 and "Lohengrin"
                                in 1850. However, at the same time, Wagner became involved with political
                                radicals. He was forced to Switzerland after his participation in the 
                                1849 Dresden uprisings.</br>
                            </br>

                                In exile, Wagner began work on his four opera cycle, "Der Ring des 
                                Nibelungen," which occupied much of his life. Taking time off from his 
                                work on the "Ring", Wagner composed the romantic tragedy, "Tristan und
                                Isolde." The opera, "Die Meistersinger" followed a few years later. This
                                opera is notorious for the anti-Semitic expressions of the protagonist.</br>
                            </br>

                                In 1860, he was allowed to return to Germany. A triumphant performance of 
                                "Tannhäuser" in Paris confirmed Wagner's stature as international artist of 
                                great renown. </br>
                            </br>

                                Finally in 1876, the "Ring" premiered in Bayreuth. The strain of raising
                                money and getting the production ready greatly affected Wagner's health.
                                His final opera, "Parsifal," was presented at the second Bayreuth festival
                                in 1882.</br>
                            </br>

                                Wagner died on February 13th, 1883 at the age of 69.

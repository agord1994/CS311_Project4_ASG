I had some issues with connecting externally to bootstrap. Apparently there are two ways of utilizing bootstap framework. One is internal from the source code </br>
saved on my computer. Then there is another method to establish an external connection via a link provided on bootstrap.com. I chose to utilize the external method.</br>
This brought up another issue where if I wanted to create my own css stylesheet for the webpage I would have two referenced stylesheets. I had to do some research on </br>
if it's actually possible to do this, and if it is, which stylesheet takes precedence. It turns out it is possible and, the one that is stated in header first will receive</br>
precedence over the other one.</br>
</br>

Another thing I had I hard time conceptualizing is the bootstrap framework itself. It took a great deal of effort and research on how to implement the layouts,containers, and components bootstrap has to offer.</br>
In this project I was able to implement the navigation tool bar at the top of all the composer webpages and I even utilized the grid system in bootstrap.  I found that experimenting with different CSS keywords</br>
as a bit time consuming, but the only way to understand the function of each keyword thouroughly.
